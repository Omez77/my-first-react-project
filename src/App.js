      <p>I go by many names Omar, Omez, and Peetie Peetie (Dont Ask)</p>
      <p>My favorite quote is from Friedrich Nietzsche who said,"God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers."</p>
      <p>My hobbies are listening to music, working out, playing football and basketball, playing guitar, playing videogames, and hanging out with friends.</p>
